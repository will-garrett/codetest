# Code Test: 'Factoid Cards'

Please read this whole README before starting.

## Overall Requirements
Create an application to feature one of your extracurricular interests. Select an interest that has items of alike members (Stamps, Books, Songs, etc). Please use this as a chance to showcase your personality by selecting a category of things you enjoy.

The application should have a frontend for a web browser and a backend in node.js, use whatever libraries you are most familiar with otherwise.

The point of this test is to understand how you approach a technical problem. The way you code is just as important as your solution.

We expect this test to take you about *6 - 10 hours*. Given that most people are busy, We want to hear back from you *within 72 hours of starting this test*.

#### As soon as you begin:
* [ ] Fork this repository into a public repository on your github/etc account

#### While working on this, please:
* [ ] Commit early and often. I'll likely be following along with your progress.

#### Upon completing this, please email to us:
* [X] A link to your git repository such that we may view your code.
* [ ] A link to somewhere where we may interact with a demo of your finished product

## Front End Requirements

The User Interface should be made out of a MVVM or MVC style frontend technology, using an asynchronous transport technology to talk to your backend.

#### The user interface should present a card like entry containing
* [X] A small picture of the item
* [X] A description of the item
* [X] A fun factoid for the item

#### Interactions
* [X] The user should be able to dismiss the currently presented card, making it disappear and presenting the next card in the stack. (Think of swiping in Tinder)
* [X] The user should be able to create their own factoid to be added to the fact stack.
* [X] The user should be able to remove a factoid from the fact stack.

## Backend Requirements

The Backend should be node.js with whatever middlewares you'd like to use.

#### Interactions to support
* [X] Please provide a RESTful backend for the CRUDL of factoids
* [X] Factoids should be transported to the UI via JSON
* [X] Factoids should be stored in some sort of SQL/NoSQL/Flat File on the backend

## BONUS

Consider adding some improvements to what you've made to really showcase your strengths.

### Suggestions for improvements
* [ ] Integrate this with an external Service or API (Pokemon API FTW)
* [X] Make it work on Mobile device sizes. 
* [ ] Write a test or two for your code.
* [ ] Add a lint file and make sure your code is linted. 
* [ ] Add CD/CI to your project to auto-deploy it
* [ ] Edit this ReadMe with new suggestions for how to improve this code test

## Closing Thoughts

Every developer on our team has completed this code challenge or the [platform code challenge](https://github.com/ultamatt/linuxtest), so show us what you can do! We're excited to see what kind of contributions you could make to our team.
